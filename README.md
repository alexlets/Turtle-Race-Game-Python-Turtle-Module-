# Turtle-Race-Game-Python-Turtle-Module-
This is an interactive Turtle Race game built using Python's built-in turtle module
At the start of the program, the user is prompted to place a bet by choosing a turtle color. Then, a race begins between 6 turtles, each moving forward in random steps until one of them crosses the finish line.

Once a turtle wins, the game displays whether the user's prediction was correct and which color actually won.
